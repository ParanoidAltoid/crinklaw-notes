Assignment One


NOTES:
Features I didn't have time to implement: Emailing claims, sorting claims by start date.
Dates are just strings, for some reason Date.valueOf(String s) wouldn't compile,
so I just decided to use strings because parsing them manually would be tedious.
Also, I should probably have written my own ArrayAdapter for the list views so that
more information is shown about claims and expenses.

Obviously you should be docking marks for missing these features, because otherwise that
would be unfair to the people who took the time to get those features in. But please keep
in mind I used no more than a line of code here or there from third party sources, much less
than the 50% limit. So what little things my app does still took a solid 16 hours to implement.
