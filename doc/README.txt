Assignment One


NOTES:
I used context menus to edit claims and expenses, so you have to hold down
to edit them.

Emailing was a last minute addition and didn't make the UML.

Features I didn't have time to implement: Sorting claims by start date.
Dates are just strings, for some reason Date.valueOf(String s) wouldn't compile,
so I just decided to use strings because parsing them manually would be tedious.
Also, I should probably have written my own ArrayAdapter for the list views so that
more information is shown about claims and expenses.
